Equine coronavirus has been responsible for several outbreaks of disease in the
United States and Japan. Only one complete genome sequence (NC99 isolated in the 
US) had been reported for this pathogenic RNA virus. Here, we report the complete
genome sequences of three equine coronaviruses isolated in 2009 and 2012 in
Japan. The genome sequences of Tokachi09, Obihiro12-1 and Obihiro12-2 were
30,782, 30,916 and 30,916 nucleotides in length, respectively, excluding the
3'-poly (A) tails. All three isolates were genetically similar to NC99
(98.2-98.7%), but deletions and insertions were observed in the genes nsp3 of
ORF1a, NS2 and p4.7.

The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome from two yellow fever (YF) virus
vaccine strains, 17DD and 17D-213, has been determined. Comparison of these
sequences with those of other YF viruses including the parental virulent Asibi
strain allowed the identification of 48 nucleotide sequence differences which are
common to all 17D substrains. This is a significant reduction from the 67
nucleotide changes originally reported as being 17D-specific and potentially
related to viral attenuation. The 48 changes are scattered throughout the genome,
26 of which are silent and 22 led to amino acid substitutions. These 22 changes
are bona fide candidates to test by mutating the infectious YF cDNA to
investigate their role in viral attenuation.

The live attenuated yellow fever (YF) vaccine strain 17D is one of the safest
vaccines in use today with only 22 cases of reversion to virulence documented
from over 300 million doses administered. We have isolated virus in cell culture 
from sera of six volunteers who received 17D vaccine and found that very few
nucleotide mutations were detected in the consensus sequence of the entire genome
of each of the serum viruses. Moreover, most of these mutations accumulated in
the non-structural protein genes, especially the NS5 protein gene. Although no
nucleotide change was identified in the structural protein genes of any of these 
six serum viruses, minor sequence heterogeneity existed in the serum virus
population. Our results indicate that 17D vaccine virus accumulates mutations at 
a very low frequency and may explain in part the excellent safety record of 17D
vaccine.

* Flavivirus NS2B and NS3 protease (NS3pro) domain profiles *
*************************************************************

Pathogenic members  of  the  flavivirus family [E1], including West Nile Virus
(WNV) and Dengue Virus (DV), are growing global threats for which there are no
specific treatments.  The  genome  encodes  three structural proteins found in
the mature virion (C, prM, and E) and seven "nonstructural" (i.e., not part of
the virion architecture) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).
Full-length NS3  is  a  bifunctional  protein.  The  N-terminal  175  residues
comprise a  chymotrypsin-like protease, "NS3pro", while the C-terminal portion
is a   helicase  ("NS3hel").  The  NS2B  protein,  which  is  located  in  the
polypeptide precursor  immediately upstream of the NS3pro domain, functions as
the cofactor  for  NS3pro.  A  35-48  residue  central portion is required for
protease activity  in  vitro,  while  N-  and  C-terminal flanking hydrophobic
regions are predicted to anchor the NS2B-NS3 complex into the host endoplasmic
reticulum  membrane. The  two component flaviviral enzyme NS2B-NS3 cleaves the
viral polyprotein  precursor  within the host cell, a process that is required
for viral  replication  [1,2,3].  The  NS3pro domain forms peptidase family S7
(flavivirin family) of clan PA [E2].

The NS3pro  has  a  classical  serine  protease catalytic triad (His, Asp, and
Ser). The  enzymatic  activity  of  NS3pro is enhanced by interacting with the
central 40  amino acid of NS2B which acts as an essential cofactor. The NS3pro
domain has  an  overall structure of two barrels made of six beta sheets each,
with the  active  site  located  in  the  cleft  between the barrels. The NS2B
hydrophilic core  cofactor  contributes one of the N-terminal beta sheets (see
<PDB:3L6P>) [1,2,3].

The profiles we developed cover the entire flavivirus NS2B and NS3pro domains.

**************************************************
* Superfamilies 1 and 2 helicase domain profiles *
**************************************************

Helicases  have  been  classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5) [1]. All of the
proteins  bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A
(phosphate-binding   loop   or   P-loop)   (see   <PDOC00017>)  and  Walker  B
(Mg2+-binding  aspartic acid) motifs [1]. For the two largest groups, commonly
referred  to  as  SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been
identified  [2].  These  two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and
RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be
active  as  monomers  or  dimers.  RNA  and DNA helicases are considered to be
enzymes  that  catalyze  the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an
energy-dependent manner [3].

The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two
alpha-beta   RecA-like   domains  (see  for  example  <PDB:1FUU>)  [3,4].  The
structural  homology  with  the  RecA  recombination  protein  covers the five
contiguous  parallel  beta  strands and the tandem alpha helices. ATP binds to
the  amino proximal alpha-beta domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker
B (motif  II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T)
which  was  proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities.
The  carboxy-terminal  alpha-beta  domain  is structurally very similar to the
proximal  one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that
it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one.

Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:

 - DEAD-box  RNA  helicases  (see  <PDOC00039>).  The  prototype  of  DEAD-box
   proteins  is  the translation initiation factor eIF4A. The eIF4A protein is
   an  RNA-dependent  ATPase  which  functions  together  with eIF4B as an RNA
   helicases [5].
 - DEAH-box  RNA  helicases (see <PDOC00039>). Mainly pre-mRNA-splicing factor
   ATP-dependent RNA helicases [5].
 - Eukaryotic   DNA  repair  helicase RAD3/ERCC-2, an ATP-dependent 5'-3'  DNA
   helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair of UV-damaged DNA.
 - Eukaryotic  TFIIH  basal transcription factor complex helicase XPB subunit.
   An  ATP-dependent 3'-5' DNA helicase which is a component of the core-TFIIH
   basal transcription factor, involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of
   DNA  and, when complexed to CAK, in RNA transcription by RNA polymerase II.
   It  acts  by  opening DNA either around the RNA transcription start site or
   the DNA.
 - Eukaryotic  ATP-dependent  DNA  helicase  Q. A DNA helicase that may play a
   role  in  the  repair  of DNA that is damaged by ultraviolet light or other
   mutagens.
 - Eukaryotic  ATP-dependent  helicase  SNF2/RAD54.  A  group of ATP-dependent
   remodelling factors frequently found associated with histone deacetylases.
 - Bacterial  and  eukaryotic antiviral SKI2-like helicase. SKI2 has a role in
   the  3'-mRNA  degradation  pathway. It represses dsRNA virus propagation by
   specifically  blocking  translation of viral mRNAs, perhaps recognizing the
   absence of CAP or poly(A).
 - Bacterial  DNA-damage-inducible  protein  G  (DinG).  A  probable  helicase
   involved in DNA repair and perhaps also replication.
 - Bacterial  primosomal  protein  N'  (PriA).  PriA  protein  is one of seven
   proteins  that  make  up  the restart primosome, an apparatus that promotes
   assembly   of   replisomes   at  recombination  intermediates  and  stalled
   replication forks.
 - Bacterial  ATP-dependent  DNA  helicase  recG.  It  has  a critical role in
   recombination   and   DNA   repair.  It  helps  process  Holliday  junction
   intermediates  to  mature products by catalyzing branch migration. It has a
   DNA  unwinding  activity  characteristic  of a DNA helicase with a 3' to 5'
   polarity.
 - ssRNA positive-strand  flaviviruses and potyviruses RNA helicase.
 - dsDNA viruses early transcription factor 70 kDa subunit.
 - dsDNA  viruses  nucleoside  triphosphatase I (NPH I) protein. It serves two
   roles   in  transcription;  it  acts  in  concert  with  viral  termination
   factor/capping enzyme to catalyze release of UUUUUNU-containing nascent RNA
   from  the  elongation  complex,  and  it  acts  by  itself  as a polymerase
   elongation factor to facilitate readthrough of intrinsic pause sites.
 - Poxviruses  transcript  release  DNA  helicase.  It  prevents virus-induced
   breakdown of RNA. It acts as a negative transcription elongation factor. It
   is involved in an ATP-dependent manner in release of nascent RNA.

To  recognize  helicase  Superfamilies 1 and 2 we have developed two profiles.
The  first one recognizes all classical SF1 and SF2 helicases except bacterial
DinG protein  and eukaryotic Rad3 which belong to the same subfamily and which
differ  from  other  SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after
the Walker A [6]. Our second profile recognizes specifically this subfamily.

-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the third profile: ALL.

-Note: UvrD (see <PDOC51198>) also belong to SF1 but is not picked-up by these
 profiles.
-Note:  secA  is  a  bacterial protein important for protein export which also
 contains  the seven motifs characteristic of SF1 and SF2. We also developed a
 profile specific for this family (see <PDOC01016>).

*********************************************************
* RNA-directed RNA polymerase catalytic domain profiles *
*********************************************************

RNA-directed  RNA  polymerase  (RdRp)  (EC  2.7.7.48)  is an essential protein
encoded  in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage [1,2].
It  catalyses  synthesis  of  the  RNA  strand  complementary  to  a given RNA
template,  but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. The postulated
RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of
RNA  synthesis  begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a
primer-independent (de novo) mechanism. The de novo initiation consists in the
addition  of  a  nucleotide  tri-phosphate  (NTP)  to  the  3'-OH of the first
initiating   NTP.  During  the  following  so-called  elongation  phase,  this
nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the
complementary RNA product [3].

All  the  RNA-directed  RNA  polymerases,  and  many DNA-directed polymerases,
employ a fold whose organization has been likened to the shape of a right hand
with  three  subdomains  termed  fingers, palm and thumb (see <PDB:1RDR>) [4].
Only  the  palm subdomain, composed of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet
with two alpha-helices, is well conserved among all of these enzymes. In RdRp,
the palm subdomain comprises three well conserved motifs (A, B and C). Motif A
(D-x(4,5)-D)  and  motif C (GDD) are spatially juxtaposed; the Asp residues of
these  motifs  are implied in the binding of Mg2+ and/or Mn2+. The Asn residue
of  motif  B  is  involved  in  selection of ribonucleoside triphosphates over
dNTPs and thus determines whether RNA is synthesized rather than DNA [5].

RNA  viruses with no DNA stage can be placed in three main categories based on
their replication and coding strategies: positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA),
negative   ssRNA   and  double-stranded  RNA  (dsRNA)  viruses.  To  recognize
RNA-directed RNA polymerase we have developed six profiles that roughly follow
this  classification  (see below). They are all directed against the catalytic
region (palm subdomain).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile:    ALL
 positive   ssRNA   viruses,   two   small  families  of  dsRNA  viruses:  the
 Partitiviridae  and  the  Totoviridae  and  some  eukaryotic RdRps.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the second profile:   ALL
 bacteriophages RdRps.

 RdRps of the Birnaviridae family of dsRNA viruses.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the fifth profile:    ALL
 RdRps  of negative ssRNA viruses with segmented genomes except the ophiovirus
 and the varicovirus.

 RdRps   of  negative  ssRNA  viruses  with  non-segmented  genomes  plus  the
 ophiovirus and the varicovirus.

************************************************************
* Class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases family profiles *
************************************************************

Methyltransferases (MTs) (EC 2.1.1.-) constitute an important class of enzymes
present  in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from
S-adenosyl  L-methionine  (SAM  or  AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as
nitrogen,  oxygen,  sulfur  or  carbon  leading  to  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(AdoHcy)  and  a  methylated  molecule.  The substrates that are methylated by
these  enzymes  cover  virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small
molecules, to  lipids,  proteins and nucleic acids. MTs are therefore involved
in many   essential   cellular   processes   including   biosynthesis,  signal
transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [1,2,3].
More than 230 different enzymatic reactions of MTs have been described so far,
of which more than 220 use SAM as the methyl donor [E1]. A review published in
2003 [2]  divides  all  MTs  into  5  classes  based on the structure of their
catalytic domain (fold):

 - class I:    Rossmann-like                    alpha/beta
 - class II:   TIM beta/alpha-barrel            alpha/beta
 - class III:  tetrapyrrole methylase           alpha/beta
 - class IV:   SPOUT                            alpha/beta     see <PDOC51604>
 - class V:    SET domain                       all beta       see <PDOC51565>

A  more  recent  paper  [3]  based  on a study of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
methyltransferome argues for four more folds:

 - class VI:   transmembrane                    all alpha      see <PDOC51598>
 - class VII:  DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle all alpha
 - class VIII: SSo0622-like                     alpha+beta
 - class IX:   thymidylate synthetase           alpha+beta

The vast  majority  of  MTs  belong  to the Rossmann-like fold (Class I) which
consists in  a  seven-stranded  beta sheet adjoined by alpha helices. The beta
sheet contains a central topological switch-point resulting in a deep cleft in
which SAM binds. Class I MTs display two conserved positions, the first one is
a GxGxG  motif  (or  at least a GxG motif) at the end of the first beta strand
which is characteristic of a nucleotide-binding site and is hence used to bind
the adenosyl  part  of SAM, the second conserved position is an acidic residue
at the  end  of  the  second  beta strand that forms one hydrogen bond to each
hydroxyl of  the  SAM  ribose  part.  The core of these enzymes is composed by
about 150  amino acids that show very strong spatial conservation. Catechol O-
MT (EC  2.1.1.6)  is  the canonical Class I MT considering that it consists in
the exact consensus structural core with no extra domain (see <PDB:1VID>) [2].

Sequence results are presented for a 3745-nucleotide region at the 5' end of the 
dengue type-1 virus (DEN-1) genome. The strain characterized is a Western Pacific
isolate from Nauru Island. The sequenced region contains the beginning of a
continuous open reading frame which specifies the capsid (C), membrane (M), and
envelope (E) structural proteins and the nonstructural protein NS1. The sequences
are compared with corresponding segments for seven other flaviviruses, including 
two of the three remaining dengue serotypes, DEN-2 and DEN-4. The results show
the DEN-1 genome size and organization to be similar to those of other
characterized flaviviruses and that major features of the individual proteins are
conserved. It is of special interest that comparisons of the E glycoprotein
sequences between the dengue serotypes (DEN-1, -2, -4) reveal only moderately
greater sequence relatedness (63-68%) than occurs in comparisons of DEN-1 with
five other flaviviruses (46-54%). For the other structural proteins, C and M, the
relatedness values are 59-74% for comparisons between DEN-1 and the other dengue 
serotypes and 31-45% for comparisons between DEN-1 and the five other
flaviviruses.

The structural protein-coding genomic regions of dengue virus type 1 (DEN-1)
strains representing three distinct topotypes (Thailand, Philippines and
Caribbean) were cloned and sequenced. In addition the envelope (E) nucleotide
sequences of two recent Caribbean topotype DEN-1 isolates were obtained by direct
RNA sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of the DEN-1 viruses in the structural
gene region was found to be highly conserved with greater than 95% nucleotide
sequence homology and with less than 4% change in the amino acid sequence.
Although there was a less than 2% change in the nucleotide sequence of DEN-1 E
proteins, strains could be differentiated by the clusters of nucleotide changes. 
Furthermore, the deduced amino acid changes in the E protein were clustered
primarily within the proposed immunologically reactive regions. Genomic
nucleotide sequence comparisons did not define geographical or virulence markers 
but located unique clusters of nucleotide/amino acid changes for each of the
three topotypes of DEN-1 viruses examined.

Evidence is presented which indicates that the dengue-2 virus nonstructural
protein NS1 (soluble complement fixing antigen) exists in infected BHK and
mosquito cell cultures as part of a stable oligomer. Identification of the
dissociation products of the isolated oligomer and comparison of the number of
N-linked glycans in native and denatured NS1 is consistent with the idea that the
high-molecular-weight form of NS1 is a homodimer. By analyzing lysates of BHK
cells infected with St. Louis encephalitis virus or Powassan virus and proteins
from dengue-2 virus-infected mouse brain we have demonstrated that the appearance
of the high-molecular-weight form of NS1 is a general feature of flavivirus
infection. It is formed between 20 and 40 min after NS1 is synthesized and before
the protein passes the Golgi apparatus. Both soluble and pelletable extracellular
NS1 are also found as the high-molecular-weight form.

* Flavivirus NS2B and NS3 protease (NS3pro) domain profiles *
*************************************************************

Pathogenic members  of  the  flavivirus family [E1], including West Nile Virus
(WNV) and Dengue Virus (DV), are growing global threats for which there are no
specific treatments.  The  genome  encodes  three structural proteins found in
the mature virion (C, prM, and E) and seven "nonstructural" (i.e., not part of
the virion architecture) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).
Full-length NS3  is  a  bifunctional  protein.  The  N-terminal  175  residues
comprise a  chymotrypsin-like protease, "NS3pro", while the C-terminal portion
is a   helicase  ("NS3hel").  The  NS2B  protein,  which  is  located  in  the
polypeptide precursor  immediately upstream of the NS3pro domain, functions as
the cofactor  for  NS3pro.  A  35-48  residue  central portion is required for
protease activity  in  vitro,  while  N-  and  C-terminal flanking hydrophobic
regions are predicted to anchor the NS2B-NS3 complex into the host endoplasmic
reticulum  membrane. The  two component flaviviral enzyme NS2B-NS3 cleaves the
viral polyprotein  precursor  within the host cell, a process that is required
for viral  replication  [1,2,3].  The  NS3pro domain forms peptidase family S7
(flavivirin family) of clan PA [E2].

The NS3pro  has  a  classical  serine  protease catalytic triad (His, Asp, and
Ser). The  enzymatic  activity  of  NS3pro is enhanced by interacting with the
central 40  amino acid of NS2B which acts as an essential cofactor. The NS3pro
domain has  an  overall structure of two barrels made of six beta sheets each,
with the  active  site  located  in  the  cleft  between the barrels. The NS2B
hydrophilic core  cofactor  contributes one of the N-terminal beta sheets (see
<PDB:3L6P>) [1,2,3].

The profiles we developed cover the entire flavivirus NS2B and NS3pro domains.

**************************************************
* Superfamilies 1 and 2 helicase domain profiles *
**************************************************

Helicases  have  been  classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5) [1]. All of the
proteins  bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A
(phosphate-binding   loop   or   P-loop)   (see   <PDOC00017>)  and  Walker  B
(Mg2+-binding  aspartic acid) motifs [1]. For the two largest groups, commonly
referred  to  as  SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has been
identified  [2].  These  two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA and
RNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to be
active  as  monomers  or  dimers.  RNA  and DNA helicases are considered to be
enzymes  that  catalyze  the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in an
energy-dependent manner [3].

The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with two
alpha-beta   RecA-like   domains  (see  for  example  <PDB:1FUU>)  [3,4].  The
structural  homology  with  the  RecA  recombination  protein  covers the five
contiguous  parallel  beta  strands and the tandem alpha helices. ATP binds to
the  amino proximal alpha-beta domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and Walker
B (motif  II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T)
which  was  proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities.
The  carboxy-terminal  alpha-beta  domain  is structurally very similar to the
proximal  one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting that
it may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one.

Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below:

 - DEAD-box  RNA  helicases  (see  <PDOC00039>).  The  prototype  of  DEAD-box
   proteins  is  the translation initiation factor eIF4A. The eIF4A protein is
   an  RNA-dependent  ATPase  which  functions  together  with eIF4B as an RNA
   helicases [5].
 - DEAH-box  RNA  helicases (see <PDOC00039>). Mainly pre-mRNA-splicing factor
   ATP-dependent RNA helicases [5].
 - Eukaryotic   DNA  repair  helicase RAD3/ERCC-2, an ATP-dependent 5'-3'  DNA
   helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair of UV-damaged DNA.
 - Eukaryotic  TFIIH  basal transcription factor complex helicase XPB subunit.
   An  ATP-dependent 3'-5' DNA helicase which is a component of the core-TFIIH
   basal transcription factor, involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of
   DNA  and, when complexed to CAK, in RNA transcription by RNA polymerase II.
   It  acts  by  opening DNA either around the RNA transcription start site or
   the DNA.
 - Eukaryotic  ATP-dependent  DNA  helicase  Q. A DNA helicase that may play a
   role  in  the  repair  of DNA that is damaged by ultraviolet light or other
   mutagens.
 - Eukaryotic  ATP-dependent  helicase  SNF2/RAD54.  A  group of ATP-dependent
   remodelling factors frequently found associated with histone deacetylases.
 - Bacterial  and  eukaryotic antiviral SKI2-like helicase. SKI2 has a role in
   the  3'-mRNA  degradation  pathway. It represses dsRNA virus propagation by
   specifically  blocking  translation of viral mRNAs, perhaps recognizing the
   absence of CAP or poly(A).
 - Bacterial  DNA-damage-inducible  protein  G  (DinG).  A  probable  helicase
   involved in DNA repair and perhaps also replication.
 - Bacterial  primosomal  protein  N'  (PriA).  PriA  protein  is one of seven
   proteins  that  make  up  the restart primosome, an apparatus that promotes
   assembly   of   replisomes   at  recombination  intermediates  and  stalled
   replication forks.
 - Bacterial  ATP-dependent  DNA  helicase  recG.  It  has  a critical role in
   recombination   and   DNA   repair.  It  helps  process  Holliday  junction
   intermediates  to  mature products by catalyzing branch migration. It has a
   DNA  unwinding  activity  characteristic  of a DNA helicase with a 3' to 5'
   polarity.
 - ssRNA positive-strand  flaviviruses and potyviruses RNA helicase.
 - dsDNA viruses early transcription factor 70 kDa subunit.
 - dsDNA  viruses  nucleoside  triphosphatase I (NPH I) protein. It serves two
   roles   in  transcription;  it  acts  in  concert  with  viral  termination
   factor/capping enzyme to catalyze release of UUUUUNU-containing nascent RNA
   from  the  elongation  complex,  and  it  acts  by  itself  as a polymerase
   elongation factor to facilitate readthrough of intrinsic pause sites.
 - Poxviruses  transcript  release  DNA  helicase.  It  prevents virus-induced
   breakdown of RNA. It acts as a negative transcription elongation factor. It
   is involved in an ATP-dependent manner in release of nascent RNA.

To  recognize  helicase  Superfamilies 1 and 2 we have developed two profiles.
The  first one recognizes all classical SF1 and SF2 helicases except bacterial
DinG protein  and eukaryotic Rad3 which belong to the same subfamily and which
differ  from  other  SF1-SF2 helicases by the presence of a large insert after
the Walker A [6]. Our second profile recognizes specifically this subfamily.

 contains  the seven motifs characteristic of SF1 and SF2. We also developed a
 profile specific for this family (see <PDOC01016>).

*********************************************************
* RNA-directed RNA polymerase catalytic domain profiles *
*********************************************************

RNA-directed  RNA  polymerase  (RdRp)  (EC  2.7.7.48)  is an essential protein
encoded  in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage [1,2].
It  catalyses  synthesis  of  the  RNA  strand  complementary  to  a given RNA
template,  but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. The postulated
RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of
RNA  synthesis  begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a
primer-independent (de novo) mechanism. The de novo initiation consists in the
addition  of  a  nucleotide  tri-phosphate  (NTP)  to  the  3'-OH of the first
initiating   NTP.  During  the  following  so-called  elongation  phase,  this
nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the
complementary RNA product [3].

All  the  RNA-directed  RNA  polymerases,  and  many DNA-directed polymerases,
employ a fold whose organization has been likened to the shape of a right hand
with  three  subdomains  termed  fingers, palm and thumb (see <PDB:1RDR>) [4].
Only  the  palm subdomain, composed of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet
with two alpha-helices, is well conserved among all of these enzymes. In RdRp,
the palm subdomain comprises three well conserved motifs (A, B and C). Motif A
(D-x(4,5)-D)  and  motif C (GDD) are spatially juxtaposed; the Asp residues of
these  motifs  are implied in the binding of Mg2+ and/or Mn2+. The Asn residue
of  motif  B  is  involved  in  selection of ribonucleoside triphosphates over
dNTPs and thus determines whether RNA is synthesized rather than DNA [5].

RNA  viruses with no DNA stage can be placed in three main categories based on
their replication and coding strategies: positive single-stranded RNA (ssRNA),
negative   ssRNA   and  double-stranded  RNA  (dsRNA)  viruses.  To  recognize
RNA-directed RNA polymerase we have developed six profiles that roughly follow
this  classification  (see below). They are all directed against the catalytic
region (palm subdomain).

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the first profile:    ALL
 positive   ssRNA   viruses,   two   small  families  of  dsRNA  viruses:  the
 Partitiviridae  and  the  Totoviridae  and  some  eukaryotic RdRps.

************************************************************
* Class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases family profiles *
************************************************************

Methyltransferases (MTs) (EC 2.1.1.-) constitute an important class of enzymes
present  in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from
S-adenosyl  L-methionine  (SAM  or  AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as
nitrogen,  oxygen,  sulfur  or  carbon  leading  to  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(AdoHcy)  and  a  methylated  molecule.  The substrates that are methylated by
these  enzymes  cover  virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small
molecules, to  lipids,  proteins and nucleic acids. MTs are therefore involved
in many   essential   cellular   processes   including   biosynthesis,  signal
transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [1,2,3].
More than 230 different enzymatic reactions of MTs have been described so far,
of which more than 220 use SAM as the methyl donor [E1]. A review published in
2003 [2]  divides  all  MTs  into  5  classes  based on the structure of their
catalytic domain (fold):

 - class I:    Rossmann-like                    alpha/beta
 - class II:   TIM beta/alpha-barrel            alpha/beta
 - class III:  tetrapyrrole methylase           alpha/beta
 - class IV:   SPOUT                            alpha/beta     see <PDOC51604>
 - class V:    SET domain                       all beta       see <PDOC51565>

A  more  recent  paper  [3]  based  on a study of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
methyltransferome argues for four more folds:

 - class VI:   transmembrane                    all alpha      see <PDOC51598>
 - class VII:  DNA/RNA-binding 3-helical bundle all alpha
 - class VIII: SSo0622-like                     alpha+beta
 - class IX:   thymidylate synthetase           alpha+beta

The vast  majority  of  MTs  belong  to the Rossmann-like fold (Class I) which
consists in  a  seven-stranded  beta sheet adjoined by alpha helices. The beta
sheet contains a central topological switch-point resulting in a deep cleft in
which SAM binds. Class I MTs display two conserved positions, the first one is
a GxGxG  motif  (or  at least a GxG motif) at the end of the first beta strand
which is characteristic of a nucleotide-binding site and is hence used to bind
the adenosyl  part  of SAM, the second conserved position is an acidic residue
at the  end  of  the  second  beta strand that forms one hydrogen bond to each
hydroxyl of  the  SAM  ribose  part.  The core of these enzymes is composed by
about 150  amino acids that show very strong spatial conservation. Catechol O-
MT (EC  2.1.1.6)  is  the canonical Class I MT considering that it consists in
the exact consensus structural core with no extra domain (see <PDB:1VID>) [2].
